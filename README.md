### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Anton
### My past experience in a variety of fields gives me an important perspective that helps elevate my projects. Being a science nerd I have an unceasing thirst for knowledge. I'm always up for a challenge and I equally enjoy working individually or as part of a team. I love building a community of like-minded people to inspire creativity, share perspectives, and exchange knowledge. I am currently studying C#, JavaScript, and React at Epicodus, a highly intensive coding boot camp, and I am beyond excited to further expand my skill set.
